            <img src="assets/images/stephen_green1.jpg" alt="Stephen Green" class="auth-image">

            <p>I am a junior Front-End Web Developer/Marketing Enthusiast with a passion for creating aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly websites that provide users with a pleasant and pain free experience while surfing the web.</p>
            <p>I recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of Utah's Full-Stack Development coding boot camp. While enrolled in the program I had the opportunity to work on several homework assignments and team projects, most of which can be accessed through the links on the portfolio tab or through my GitHub account. All of these pushed me to stretch myself and to think outside the box a little and that's another thing I love about coding, there's always something to learn, always a different way to do something, always somebody willing to help, it's great to learn from other people and make friends along the way. I also developed some new skills including HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SQL server and responsive web design.</p>
            <p>With my background in sales and more recently risk operations, one might ask, “Why web development, Shouldn't you be a data analyst?” Answer: It's an amazing feeling to take an idea, a vision and build it into something that's not only beautiful but functional, also in my opinion and experience, designing and building websites is more fun than staring at data all day. However, in each role that I've had over the years I’ve learned valuable skills that I bring to my web development projects. In sales, I learned about relationships and persistence, nobody wins on their own and people do business with people they can trust. While in risk operations I learned the basics of data analysis and how to look at a problem holistically while not neglecting the finer details. My bachelor's degree in Marketing Management from Western Governors University helped me understand how to deliver shared value for both consumers and companies, specifically how to truly understand the user story.</p>
            <p>In my current role I am known for my inquisitive mind, willingness to dive head on into difficult projects and ability to learn quickly. All of these traits combined with my new skills make me an ideal candidate for my preferred positions of digital marketer, full-stack developer or UX/UI designer.</p>
